\chapter{Introduction}
This report describes the implementation of a previously designed cache simulator made for a pregraduate project in the course \textbf{IV1350} at KTH in Stockholm. The implementation is not for production usage.

\begin{small}
While implementing the application, I co-operated with \textit{Martin Alge}, \textit{Jesper Falk} and \textit{Erik Pettersson}.
\end{small}

\chapter{Method}
In the process of procuring a working application that would run an implementation of the design bescribed in \textit{Assignment 2}\footnote{http://web.ict.kth.se/$\sim$emiltu/iv1350-emiltu-s2.pdf} Java were selected as being the preferred language in the documentation of the course.

The Java environment during the course of developing the application have consisted of the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item OpenJDK Runtime Environment (\textbf{IcedTea} 2.4.4) (7u51-2.4.4-0ubuntu0.13.10.1)
	\item \textbf{rake} 10.3.0
	\item \textbf{rakejava} 1.3.7
	\item \textbf{javac} 1.7.0\_51
	\item \textbf{git} 1.8.3.2
\end{itemize}

As the application was already largely designed, implementation was made simplified. As the design was having a largely low coupling - it was possible to implement the separate classes for the design one by one, thus rapidly having a working application. The application were mostly written after the design with modifications were seemingly proper. During a period in the development process, the classes \texttt{CacheLayout} and \texttt{AddressLayout} was merged in the \texttt{CacheLayout}-class, but that idea was quickly scrapped since the class were dangerously close to becoming a megamodel containing most of the logic in the application.

The tests made their way into the application quite late, which have caused a couple of hours of unnecessary debugging for bugs that would've been quickly discovered if the tests had been written before the actual code of the application, as the bugs were mostly quite clumsy.
